        i have planned a project of some complexity scoping the information flow. For example, designing a structure for an e-portfolio with a title page linking to subjects of interest, listing the information sources needed for input, the software tools they will use for processing information to include in their portfolio and the intended audience for their finished product. They should provide evidence that they have considered costs and where relevant the file formats generated by the tools in order to make information widely accessible. Will their work force other people to have to buy software in order to access it? Planning should consider such issues to avoid problems later on when the project has been completed (PLTS)
        Plans should typically be based on an aim, some specific objectives and/or SMART (Specific Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-limited) targets. Candidates should realise the importance of objectives and targets that can be rationally evaluated rather than vague statements of aim. An example in the context of an e-portfolio might be to provide 3 screen sized pages for 3 subjects by 31st July. Resources required are 30 hours of time and access to the Drupal Content Management System. Plans should include concise descriptions of the methods and actions needed for success and these can relate directly to the range of assessment criteria in this section. Contingency plans should also be detailed and included as well as how and why they would come into play
