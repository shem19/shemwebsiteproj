            <P>

                    3.1 I can evaluate the productivity and efficiency of IT systems and procedures used by self and others . For example, sending e-mail can be more efficient than talking to someone when all that is required is a specific piece of information. Discussing the details of how to use a new software tool by e-mail or text messaging is likely to be a lot less efficient than a spoken conversation and so review should include discriminating use of ICT. Other factors such as the lack of expression and remoteness of technology can lead to "flame wars" that would reduce efficiency.
                    Information entered directly into a web page can be much more efficient than making a word processed file and attaching it to the page. Firstly there is no need for word processing software, secondly the information is immediately available to users without having to download a file and having software for opening and viewing it. Social networking can be very powerful, but it can also be a major distraction to the focus required for efficient working.
                    i have discussed this in forums or verbally to form their views and so assessors might provide a witness statement or video to acknowledge this.
